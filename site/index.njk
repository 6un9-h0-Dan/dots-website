    <p>Decentralized technologies enable alternative applications that challenge the traditional models: where government and corporate control are causing harm, decentralized technologies can bring about autonomy, resilience, and equity.</p>

    <p>However, there is a significant gap between the protocols that define the decentralization space and the applications that users want to adopt. Through research, focus groups, and interviews, we identified 7 areas where people and projects behind decentralization efforts see old and new challenges.</p>

    <p>One of the missing aspects are libraries and tools that developers and designers can use to understand how to build applications. This will be our focus from now on:  producing a library of resources, assets, and patterns to be a toolkit supporting the design and development of better user-facing tools that are backed by decentralized architecture. By connecting the different communities, we also hope to close the feedback loop between users and protocol developers.</p>

    <h2>Need design help?</h2>
    
    <p>We are looking for partners and collaborators to workshop UX/UI and architecture patterns. We believe that by addressing the specific needs and challenges of your project, we can learn valuable lessons that would apply to the community as a whole. Every piece of design work we do will feed into the production of our pattern library.</p>
