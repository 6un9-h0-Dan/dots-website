      <h2>Design Sprints</h2>
      <p>
        We offer remote design support, ranging from 3-hour workshops to
        week-long sprints. Topics may include (but are not limited to):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Developing a UX/UI pattern for a particular workflow</li>
        <li>
          Workshopping terminology, explanation, or illustrations for onboarding
        </li>
        <li>Designing a feature from the ground up</li>
        <li>Beginning user research and testing</li>
        <li>Reviewing of current designs based on best practices</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Architecture Sprints</h2>
      <p>piece of documentation, feature implementation</p>
      <p>Paired with a design sprint:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Is your arch. ready for a particular design?</li>
        <li>What strategies could be used to reach your design goals?</li>
        <li>Architecture review with a usability implications report</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Standalone:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Developer-facing documentation, examples</li>
        <li>
          We build an example application with your protocol or developer facing
          library, and give feedback to your team.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Informational Interview</h2>
      <p>
        You are working on a decentralized protocol or application, and would
        like to share your thoughts about UX/UI and architecture design? We are
        putting together practical guidelines for application developers
        interested in decentralization, and are interested in hearing your
        perspective. Our research focuses on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What use cases are decentralized applications being applied to?</li>
        <li>
          What user experience pattern does your application use for X, Y, Z
          feature?
        </li>
        <li>
          What protocol or library do you use for an application with some given
          constraints?
        </li>
        <li>
          What are the trade-offs in approaches for key user interactions such
          as multi-device, backup, and discoverability?
        </li>
        <li>Who is currently working on X, Y, Z topic?</li>
      </ul>
