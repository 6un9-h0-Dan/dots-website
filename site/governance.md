# Governance

## Basics

The project's Maintainers hold ultimate decision-making power while seeking to represent a balance of the views and the best interests of the community as a whole.

DOTS aims to create tooling and resources that help the decentralization community with usability and adoption.

Our core values are: mutual respect, open-mindedness, human-centric approaches, inclusion.

All design assets created are licensed under CC-BY. All code created is open source. The legal entity sponsoring DOTS is Simply Secure, a US 501\(c\)3.

## Participants

Participation is open to anyone who wants to join.

The Maintainers can remove misbehaving participants at will for the sake of the common good. We follow [Simply Secure's Code of Conduct](https://simplysecure.org/coc/).

Participants involved in the development of the pattern library are Contributors, participants involved in advising DOTS on strategy and fundraising are Advisors.

In the event that one of the Maintainers is unable or unwilling to continue leadership, they may appoint new a Maintainer or choose to alter the governance structure entirely.

## Policy

The Maintainers set the community's policies and make decisions for the community, taking reasonable account of input from other community participants.

The Maintainers are responsible for implementing—or delegating implementation of—policies and other decisions.

If participants are not happy with the Maintainers' leadership, they are free to voice their concerns or leave the community.

## Process

Access to accounts sit with the Maintainers, and can be shared with Contributors and Participants as needed.

The Maintainers manage all funds; distribution of funds is made transparent on GitHub and Open Collective.

Community participants are free to discuss and debate community policies, practices, and culture.

## Evolution

The Maintainers can change the governance structure of the community at will.
