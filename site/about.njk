                <em>Decentralization Off The Shelf</em> is an initiative hosted by Simply Secure, a US-based nonprofit supporting the usability of safety and privacy tools. It aligns with Simply Secure's overall goal of creating open design resources for the community.</p>
        </p>
        <p>The initiative is currently spearheaded by Eileen Wagner and Karissa McKelvey, and has a group of volunteer contributors and advisors. We are actively seeking funding for the development of further resources. You can support us by <a href="/donate">backing DOTS</a>.</p>

            <li>Program Manager, Simply Secure</li>
            <li>Eileen advises teams and organizations on UX design and research at Simply Secure. Her focus is on information architecture, content strategy, and interaction design--or anything that helps people make sense of complex technologies. She works with numerous projects in decentralization and security, and enjoys facilitating relationships between the builders and users of technology. Her background is in analytic philosophy and mathematical logic, and she wonâ€™t stop talking about singing barbershop music.</li>

        <h2>Karissa McKelvey</h2>

            <li>Karissa researches technical infrastructure and architecture design, focused on its impact on usability, safety, and resilience. Her work on Mapeo and Delta.Chat is depended upon by at-risk users including environmental & human rights defenders, journalists, and civil society activists living within repressive environments. Previously, she led user and developer experience for dat, a decentralized data sharing tool; and hypercore, a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol. Karissa's perspectives and work have been featured in high-profile news outlets such as the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and NPR.  Something about music and making weird political art that touches your funny bone.</li>
