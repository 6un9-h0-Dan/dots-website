      <h2>Design Sprints</h2>
      <p>
        We offer remote design support, ranging from 3-hour workshops to
        week-long sprints. Topics may include (but are not limited to):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Developing a UX/UI pattern for a particular workflow</li>
        <li>
          Workshopping terminology, explanation, or illustrations for onboarding
        </li>
        <li>Designing a feature from the ground up</li>
        <li>Beginning user research and testing</li>
        <li>Reviewing of current designs based on best practices</li>
        <li>Is your architecture ready for a particular design?</li>
        <li>
          What architecture adjustments could help reach your design goals?
        </li>
      </ul>

        </li>
        <li>Developer-facing documentation</li>
        <li>
          We build an example application with your protocol or developer-facing

      <h2>Informational Interview</h2>
      <p>
        Are you working on a decentralized protocol or application, and would
        like to share your thoughts? We are putting together practical
        guidelines for decentralized applications, and are interested in hearing
        your perspective. Our research focuses on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What use cases are decentralized applications being applied to?</li>
        <li>
          What user experience pattern does your application use for X, Y, Z
          feature?
        </li>
        <li>
          What protocol or library do you use for an application with some given
          constraints?
        </li>
        <li>
          What are the trade-offs in approaches for key user interactions such
          as multi-device, backup, and discoverability?
        </li>
        <li>Who is currently working on X, Y, Z topic?</li>
      </ul>
