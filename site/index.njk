        Decentralized technologies enable alternative applications that
        challenge the traditional models: where government and corporate control
        are causing harm, decentralized technologies have the potential to bring
        about autonomy, resilience, and equity.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, there is a significant gap between the protocols that define
        the decentralization space and the applications that users want to
        adopt. Through a series of interviews and focus groups with technology
        designers and builders, we have identified 7 areas where projects can
        improve their own practice; where targeted research is necessary; and
        where funders can enable collaborative innovations.

        One of the missing aspects are tools that developers and designers can
        use to understand how to build applications. We are now producing a
        library of resources, assets, and patterns to support the design and
        development of better user-facing applications that are backed by
        decentralized architecture.

        We are looking for partners and collaborators to workshop user
        experience and architecture patterns. By addressing the specific needs
        and challenges of your project, we can also learn valuable lessons that
        would apply to the community as a whole. The design work we do will feed
        into the production of our pattern library.
