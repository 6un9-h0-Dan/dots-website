## The Design Problem

In a local-first world, peers may or may not be connected to the network at all
times, and information left by the users could be out-of-date. When and how is
dated information is shown on the network?

## The Design Solution

Give a visual indication for the age of a piece of information, for example
when a peer was last seen. Fading a tag or a card usually works.

### Examples

Trello’s card ageing

## Why Choose age indicator?

Age indicator shows you information about network participants without taking
up too much space.

## Potential Problems with age indicator

When there are multiple dimensions of aging—is it when a peer was last seen? or
the last time this file was updated?—having age indicator might be confusing.
Also, if your color contrast doesn’t allow for fading, age indicator is not
a good choice here.
